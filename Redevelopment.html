      <h2>Our Redevelopment Process</h2>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          The first step is to understand the needs of the residents and study the plot. 
          We follow it up with a brief presentation about the redevelopment overview. 
          This includes the layout, draft plans, commercial terms, timelines, specifications, 
          shifting arrangements and document requirements.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          The project plan is reworked to fit-in the requirements of the members. 
          A final draft of the techno-commercial plan, with building sketches and legal agreements 
          is presented to the committee. This is followed by obtaining sanctions from the municipal/local authority.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Once commercial terms have been fulfilled, the residents are shifted into rented apartments. 
          The building is thus ready to be handed over for redevelopment. The process of redevelopment will be 
          initiated and completed as per the sanctioned plan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Once the building is ready as per the architectural assessment, aspects such as finishing, 
          inspection and various other installations will be looked into thoroughly. 
          The occupation as well as completion certificate gets cleared and the building is handed over 
          to the residents with respective inductions.
